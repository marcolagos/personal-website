# My Personal Website

This project was finished in another repository; however, this repository contains the majority of the development process. In the other repository, I removed dependencies, altered code format and file directory, and added Firestore Analytics. In addition, I fixed lengthy initial load time, reduced bundle size,
and addressed any bugs.

## Description

This is my own personal website using React for front-end and Firestore for back-end. There are five pages: Home, Projects, References, 
Contact, and About. The Home page contains a simple introduction. The Projects page contains my previous projects, including this website. 
The References page contains articles I have written. The Contact page offers a method to contact me. The About page tells a bit about myself.
