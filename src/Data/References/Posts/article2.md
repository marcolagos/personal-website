I've had the opportunity to **work with** recruiters in my career. I've taken numerous interviewer trainings, done interviews and been to a broad range of company recruitment events including events in universities. In addition to that, I get 3-5 messages on LinkedIn per day from rectuiters hiring for various companies. I talk with some of them even if I'm not interested in the job to understand what they like about my CV. This allows me to create a feedback loop where I can learn more about what attracts them.

You receive these two CVs at the same time. You have 20 seconds to pick one. Which one would you pick based on the intitial look?
